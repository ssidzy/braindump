# Embedded System Design Using UML State Machines

This module explores how to structure **robust and maintainable embedded firmware** using **UML state machine modeling techniques**.

Rather than writing ad-hoc `if-else` or `switch` blocks, state machine design enables event-driven, scalable systems ideal for:

- Menu systems
- Protocol handlers
- Control systems (motors, appliances)
- UI workflows
- RTOS task logic

## 🚦 Topics Covered

- ✅ UML state machine principles: states, transitions, events
- 🔁 State pattern implementation in C
- 🧰 Tools for modeling and visualization (PlantUML, Yakindu)
- 🔄 Integrating state machines in RTOS & interrupt-driven code
- 🧠 Hierarchical state machines for complex behavior

> This approach is a professional-grade toolset that brings structure to complex embedded software.
