# Embedded C Programming for Absolute Beginners

This module is designed to help **absolute beginners** get started with embedded systems using **C programming** and **ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers** (like STM32, TM4C, or similar).

We focus on:
- 📘 Core embedded C concepts (pointers, registers, bitwise ops)
- 💡 Blinking your first LED without Arduino/HAL
- 🧠 Understanding the "why" behind the "what"
- 🛠️ Writing simple drivers and debug setups

> No prior experience with microcontrollers is needed.
