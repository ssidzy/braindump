# Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development

Welcome to my journey through the **MCU1 course**, where I explore the world of **bare-metal embedded systems development** using **STM32 microcontrollers** — without HAL, Arduino, or third-party libraries.

This repository is a structured knowledge base containing:

- ✅ Register-level driver implementations
- 🧠 Technical deep-dives and learning notes
- 🛠️ Mini-projects and debugging practice
- 💡 Interview preparation resources

---

## 📚 Course Focus

- STM32F407xx Microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M4)
- Bare-metal C (no HAL, no Arduino)
- Full engagement with reference manuals and datasheets
- Peripheral-level understanding: GPIO, RCC, USART, I2C, SPI, NVIC, SysTick, EXTI, etc.
