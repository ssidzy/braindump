# Mastering Microcontroller: Timers, PWM, CAN, and Low Power (MCU2)

This is the second module in my embedded systems learning series. It builds upon the fundamentals in **MCU1** and focuses on **advanced microcontroller peripherals**.

## 🎯 Topics Covered

- ⏱️ Timers: Basic, General Purpose, Advanced
- ⚡ PWM: Pulse Width Modulation for motor control and signal generation
- 🚐 CAN: Controller Area Network basics and STM32 implementation
- 💤 Low Power Modes: Sleep, Stop, Standby, wake-up sources

## 🔧 Platform & Tools

- STM32F407xx (Cortex-M4)
- Bare-metal C (no HAL)
- Reference Manual + Datasheet-based development
- CubeIDE or Makefile + OpenOCD/GDB

> This module is ideal for embedded developers who want to control time-critical applications, communicate over robust protocols, and build power-efficient firmware.
