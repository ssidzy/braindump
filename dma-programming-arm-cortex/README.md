# ARM Cortex-M DMA Programming Demystified

Welcome to the deep dive into **Direct Memory Access (DMA)** programming on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. This module unpacks the internals of DMA controllers, explains how to offload data transfers from the CPU, and shows you how to write efficient, interrupt-driven firmware.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- ✅ What DMA is and why it’s crucial in real-time systems
- 🧩 Configuring DMA for memory-to-peripheral and peripheral-to-memory
- 🔁 Circular mode for continuous data streaming (e.g., audio, ADC)
- ⚙️ Interrupts and error handling for robust DMA transfers
- 🛠 Debugging DMA issues using STM32CubeIDE, GDB, or logic analyzers

### 🎯 Target Platform

- ARM Cortex-M (STM32F4/STM32F1 preferred)
- Register-level configuration (no HAL)
- Bare-metal C

> This course is for embedded developers who want to move from CPU-bound polling to efficient, non-blocking, DMA-driven systems.
