# ðŸ§  Braindump

Welcome to **Braindump** â€” my personal knowledge hub for everything Iâ€™m learning and building.
Itâ€™s a mix of **notes, code, reference materials, and projects** spanning topics like **Embedded Systems, Linux, C/C++, Assembly, Python, and even LLMs/AI**.

This repo is my *digital notebook*, organized so I can revisit concepts, practice, and share structured learning paths.
