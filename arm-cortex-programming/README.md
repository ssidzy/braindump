# Embedded Systems Programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4 Processors

This section dives deep into low-level programming of the **ARM Cortex-M3 and M4 cores**, the heart of most 32-bit embedded systems today.

We cover:
- ✅ CPU architecture & core registers
- 🔄 Exception/interrupt handling
- 🧠 Stack usage, context switching
- 🧰 Memory mapping and peripheral access
- ⚙️ Startup files, linker scripts, and vector tables
- 🧮 Floating Point Unit (M4 only)

> This knowledge is essential for building highly efficient, deterministic, and low-footprint firmware in a bare-metal or RTOS context.

### 🎯 Target Audience

- Embedded engineers moving beyond vendor libraries (e.g., HAL)
- Developers preparing for interviews or bare-metal roles
- Students transitioning from Arduino to real-world embedded development
