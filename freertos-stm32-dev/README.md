# Mastering RTOS: Hands-on FreeRTOS with STM32Fx and Debugging

This module provides a hands-on deep dive into **FreeRTOS on STM32 microcontrollers**, focusing on **practical development and real-world debugging**.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- ✅ Real-time OS fundamentals: tasks, context switching, scheduling
- 🔁 Inter-task communication: queues, semaphores, notifications
- ⚙️ FreeRTOS APIs and configuration
- 🛠️ Debugging with FreeRTOS-aware tools (CubeIDE, SEGGER SystemView)
- 🧵 RTOS-safe ISRs and shared resource management
- 🧩 Memory management and pitfalls
- 🧪 Porting FreeRTOS manually (without relying on STM32CubeMX)

> A perfect next step after bare-metal development to build **responsive, deterministic, and scalable firmware**.
